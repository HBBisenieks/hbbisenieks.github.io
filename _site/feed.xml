The lid is open, revealing the pages of a book. The words 'Tales from the TRUNK' frame the trunk.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My podcast, Tales from the Trunk: Reading the stories that didn’t make it, is
launching its first full episode on Friday, March 15th, 2019, and to get
listeners ready, a trailer episode has gone live
&lt;a href=&quot;https://talesfromthetrunk.podbean.com/&quot;&gt;today&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tales from the Trunk is a show about the times when the fiction that we’ve
written just doesn’t quite hit the mark for whatever reason. Regular episodes
feature a reading from and interview with a guest spec-fic author.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tales from the Trunk releases monthly on the third Friday of the month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can support the show on &lt;a href=&quot;https://patreon.com/trunkcast&quot;&gt;Patreon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have a copy of &lt;em&gt;Skies of Wonder&lt;/em&gt; with you, I will happily
sign it (and I have it on good authority that the other
contributors who will be there will also do so). If you don’t have
a copy but you want one, there will be a limited number in the
SFWA Book Depot. I am also likely to have some bookmarks and
badge ribbons, and I’ll happily give you one!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some notes on the care and feeding of a Hilary:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I’m not great with faces/names. If we know each other from somewhere, please tell me where!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I’m an introvert, but that doesn’t mean I don’t want to talk to you.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I’ll have business cards with me. If you have a card, too, I’d love to get one; I’ll have a better chance of remembering I met you that way.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as finding me goes, I’ll be carrying a black messenger bag
with a Hufflepuff crest on it. That’s about all I know, but I am
pretty tall, so that may help as well.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="news" /><category term="worldcon" /><category term="conventions" /><summary type="html">Worldcon 76, the 76th World Science Fiction Convention (gasp!), is happening right now in San Jose, CA, and I will be there Friday evening, Saturday, and Sunday.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Skies of Wonder Pre-orders Open!</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/news/2018/06/05/skies-of-wonder-pre-orders.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Skies of Wonder Pre-orders Open!" /><published>2018-06-05T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2018-06-05T00:00:00-07:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/news/2018/06/05/skies-of-wonder-pre-orders</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/news/2018/06/05/skies-of-wonder-pre-orders.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/SkiesOfWonder-ebook-cover-web.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Image of a sailing ship flying through clouds in the background.

&lt;p&gt;If you follow my Twitter, you may already know, but I have a new
story forthcoming in &lt;a href=&quot;https://skiesofwonder.com/&quot;&gt;Skies of Wonder, Skies of Danger: Stories of Airships, Pirates, and Wizards&lt;/a&gt;,
which is expected to release on June 14th as an ebook on all
major platforms and as a print-on-demand paperback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Skies of Wonder&lt;/em&gt; contains 13 stories of airships, pirates, and wizards (oh my!), including my story, “A Step Out Into the Blue.”&lt;/p&gt;

anything new out the door or get anything that’s out back in time
to send it out again, so I guess this is as good a time as any for
a year-in-review post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2017 in submissions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;47 story submissions sent (down from 54 in 2016)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 sale (!!!)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;37 form rejections (down from 39 in 2016)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;9 personal rejections (down from 14 in 2016)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 story published&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 new story in circulation (and one more that’d been sitting out pending a heavy revision)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was hoping to meet my average of one submission a week again this
year, but missing that mark by 5 isn’t bad by any stretch, and this
is still my second best year for raw submission numbers (and
absolute best year for paid sales) since I started this hustle back
in 2006, and that ain’t bad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Considering how rough 2017 was in general, I’m counting everything
as a victory, and there are still a few weeks left in the year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as writing goes, I didn’t end up producing that much new
stuff this year that actually went out into the world. One new
story, and one more that hadn’t been on sub since its first
outing in 2016, where it came back with a very nice, helpful
personal rejection that I didn’t know at the time how to act on.
In addition to those stories, there were a couple more pieces that
are finishing out the year at various states of drafting, so
hopefully I’ll get some of those out the door early in 2018. Maybe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as surprises for the year go, I’m a little shocked that
November didn’t come in as my lowest-submission month, given that
I was traveling for half the month. In fact, November came in
second, with 6 submissions, while August led the way with 8 subs.
However, the biggest surprise for me was my sale, which came in
in March. Obviously, we always hope that the things we write and
send out will sell, but the wording of my acceptance letter
started out so similarly to all the rejections I’ve gotten (225
lifetime rejections as of this writing), that I had to go back and
re-read the thing a couple times for it to get through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My goal, again, for 2018 is to hit 52 submissions for the year,
which means I’ll have to put some more things in circulation, so
my other 2018 goal is to get up to 10 stories into the rotation.
Wish me luck.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="blog" /><category term="review" /><category term="statistics" /><category term="submissions" /><summary type="html">It’s the middle of December, and I don’t know if I’m going to get anything new out the door or get anything that’s out back in time to send it out again, so I guess this is as good a time as any for a year-in-review post.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Mandatory Awards Post, 2017</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/blog/2017/12/18/mandatory-awards-post.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Mandatory Awards Post, 2017" /><published>2017-12-18T00:00:00-08:00</published><updated>2017-12-18T00:00:00-08:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/blog/2017/12/18/mandatory-awards-post</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/blog/2017/12/18/mandatory-awards-post.html">&lt;p&gt;Hello!

I’m not participating, because I know full well
that I’m doing too many things this month, and trying to write
fifty thousand words on top of all that is unrealistic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that doesn’t mean that you can’t. Because you can! You can do
the thing! And if you, like me, would like to over-complicate an
already difficult endeavor, maybe you want to have a way to update
your wordcount from the command line. (I mean, if you’re trying to
keep yourself from getting distracted while you’re trying to do
your daily 1800-ish words, then opening a browser to update your
word count is likely to lead you off-track. It does for me, anyway.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, for you, you wonderful dork, a Gist. May it serve you well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/HBBisenieks/702f8f5d19b780503b0a.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In case you’re wondering how &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; use this script, I usually do my
NaNoWriMo projects in plain text, writing in chunks every day,
usually named something like “chunk_20171101.txt,” with all those
chunks in a project folder. Since my main writing machine uses
Xmonad as its window manager, I can just program a custom keyboard
shortcut to invoke this script whenever I want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, with my blessing, take this terrible bit of bodged-together
code, and if you find it useful, I don’t know, tweet at me or
something.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="blog" /><category term="NaNoWriMo" /><category term="Linux" /><summary type="html">It’s NaNoWriMo!

very thing that you’re reading &lt;em&gt;right now)&lt;/em&gt; to Github Pages. This
was, in large part, because I was bored and a bit fed up with my
existing site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I coded the first iteration of HilaryBisenieks.com in 2009, writing
it all in Notepad, which is Not A Great Way. But I was young, then,
and not indoctrinated into the Church of Vim (don’t @ me). It was
small and kinda lousy, with a table-based layout. If I wanted to
update a menu entry, I had to change it in every single page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually, I re-wrote the whole structure of the site, using PHP
to make it somewhat modular. I’d already ditched the tables in
favor of divs, but now if I wanted to update a menu item, it was
a matter of changing and re-uploading only a single file. I was
basically in just the right place for Jekyll, my templates being
a series of include statements, pulling in all the little snippets
of code as desired for my blog widgets and sidebar items.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That worked. Basically. But I had occasional security issues:
random extra pages getting dropped onto my FTP server, seemingly
at random, that got the site flagged for malware on several
occasions. Which is Not Great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I wanted to redesign the thing anyway. I just didn’t really
have the motivation or the tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then &lt;a href=&quot;https://firesidefiction.com&quot;&gt;Fireside Fiction&lt;/a&gt; redid their
site and &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://firesidefiction.com/about-our-new-site&quot;&gt;talked about it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;
That lit a fire under my ass. At that point, I checked and saw
that my paid hosting through GoDaddy, who I kind of despise (but
signed on with back in the day because, again, young and ignorant),
would be coming up for renewal in about 7 months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a time-frame, and thanks to Pablo’s posts, I had an idea
of what tools I could use. From there, it just became a matter of
doing the work. So of course I left large portions un-done until
the very last minute. (In fact, there are still some things missing
that had been present on my old site.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here we are.&lt;/p&gt;
