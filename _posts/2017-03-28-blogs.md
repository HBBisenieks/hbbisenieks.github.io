I have too many blogs
===

Here they are:

* [Urban Phantasy](https://urbanphantasy.wordpress.com/) - Reviews, ramblings, and writing stuff. Updates when I feel like it.
* [Beep Boop Every Day](https://beepboopeveryday.wordpress.com/) - Tech stuff. Updates even less regularly.
* [Flash In the Pan](https://flashficinthepan.wordpress.com/) - I've posted here like five times, but it's still in my blog dashboard, so.
