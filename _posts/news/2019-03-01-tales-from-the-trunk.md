My podcast, Tales from the Trunk: Reading the stories that didn't make it, is
launching its first full episode on Friday, March 15th, 2019, and to get
listeners ready, a trailer episode has gone live
[today](https://talesfromthetrunk.podbean.com/).

Tales from the Trunk is a show about the times when the fiction that we've
written just doesn't quite hit the mark for whatever reason. Regular episodes
feature a reading from and interview with a guest spec-fic author.

Tales from the Trunk releases monthly on the third Friday of the month.

You can support the show on [Patreon](https://patreon.com/trunkcast).
