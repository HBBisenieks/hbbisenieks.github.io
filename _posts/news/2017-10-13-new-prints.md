As some folks may have guessed from my [semi-recent blog post](http://hilarybisenieks.com/blog/2017/08/30/in-brief-cthulhu-stamp.html), 
I've got a new print up in [my Etsy shop](https://www.etsy.com/shop/thejackalopeprints)!

(Honestly, I could've posted this print a month ago, but life just kept happening, as it 
often does. So it's here now, and that's the important part.)

Anyhow, if you want some Cthulhu postcards, or other postcards or prints, I'm not picky, 
head on over there.
