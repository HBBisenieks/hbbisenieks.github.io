Worldcon 76, the 76th World Science Fiction Convention (gasp!),
is happening *right now* in San Jose, CA, and I will be there
Friday evening, Saturday, and Sunday.

If you have a copy of *Skies of Wonder* with you, I will happily
sign it (and I have it on good authority that the other
contributors who will be there will also do so). If you don't have
a copy but you want one, there will be a limited number in the
SFWA Book Depot. I am also likely to have some bookmarks and
badge ribbons, and I'll happily give you one!

Some notes on the care and feeding of a Hilary:

* I'm not great with faces/names. If we know each other from somewhere, please tell me where!
* I'm an introvert, but that doesn't mean I don't want to talk to you.
* I'll have business cards with me. If you have a card, too, I'd love to get one; I'll have a better chance of remembering I met you that way.

As far as finding me goes, I'll be carrying a black messenger bag
with a Hufflepuff crest on it. That's about all I know, but I am
pretty tall, so that may help as well.
