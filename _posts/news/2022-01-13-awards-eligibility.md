It's awards nomination season once again in the SFF world, so I'm breaking the
long silence on this site (not necessarily intentional so much as, well, have
you seen the world lately?) to make a text post of my awards eligibility.

My podcast, [Tales from the Trunk](https://trunkcast.com), is eligible for the
Best Fancast category in the Hugos and the Best Audio Original - Nonfiction
category in r/Fantasy's Stabby Awards. (It's also eligible for various other
podcast awards probably, but those are basically the only podcast awards in the
genre space specifically.)

I appreciate your consideration, and I'd be honored to have a space on your
ballots.
