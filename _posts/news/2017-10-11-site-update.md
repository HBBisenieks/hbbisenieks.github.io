Maybe you noticed that something is a little... *different* around
here?

(If you're reading this and your address bar says github.io, these
aren't the droids you're looking for.)

For folks looking for the old blue and gray page, that's been
retired. Even with a lot of (hopefully invisible) improvements
on the backend, it was too much of a pain to manage, and there
were occasional security issues. Besides which, I wanted to do a
refresh and get something a little more mobile-friendly. As if
anyone other than me ever looks at my site on a mobile device...

Over the next few weeks, a lot of content will be returned to this
site in one way or another, but my hand's been forced a little:
it's either migrate now or pay for another year of hosting that I
don't really need.

Anyhow, if there's something that you're looking for that you swear
was here *just yesterday,* check back soon. Or email webmaster [at]
hilarybisenieks [dot] com.
