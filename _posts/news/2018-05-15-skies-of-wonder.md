> Elaine just wants to get some formal training as a mage and get a better job, but everything goes wrong during a routine job when the airship she's on is highjacked by pirates.

If you follow my Twitter, you may already know, but I have a new
story forthcoming in [Skies of Wonder, Skies of Danger: Stories of Airships, Pirates, and Wizards](https://twitter.com/SkiesofWonderBk),
which is expected to release on June 11th as an ebook on all
major platforms and as a print-on-demand paperback.

_Skies of Wonder_ contains 13 stories of airships, pirates, and wizards (oh my!), including my story, "A Step Out Into the Blue."

Watch this space and my twitter for more details as the release
date approaches!
