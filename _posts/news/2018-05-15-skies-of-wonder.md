In the foreground, a grinning pirate captain, in profile, raises their flintlock, and in front of them, a brown-skinned female wizard swings a censer in one hand, while her other hand is outstretched, radiating light.

If you follow my Twitter, you may already know, but I have a new
story forthcoming in [Skies of Wonder, Skies of Danger: Stories of Airships, Pirates, and Wizards](https://skiesofwonder.com/),
which is expected to release on June 14th as an ebook on all
major platforms and as a print-on-demand paperback.

_Skies of Wonder_ contains 13 stories of airships, pirates, and wizards (oh my!), including my story, "A Step Out Into the Blue."

Watch this space and my twitter for more details as the release
date approaches!
