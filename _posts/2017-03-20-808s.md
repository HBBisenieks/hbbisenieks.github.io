<h3>Presidential Politics Meet HipHop
Rivalries</h3>

<h4>By Hilary B. Bisenieks</h4>

<p>WASHINGTON &ndash; What began as
little more than a rapper's public outburst and
a supposedly off-the-record remark by the
President has evolved into history's first hip-hop-Presidential
beef.</p>

<p>In the weeks since West's interruption
of the 2009 Video Music Awards and
President Obama's now-infamous "jackass"
comment, members of both crews have been
taking daily shots at each other. These shots
began with West's diss track "Democratic
(jack)Ass," released online a day after the
comment, following an all-night recording
session by West and Chicago-based producer
No I.D. What little chance Obama had to
play the part of the bigger man was blown
soon after by a string of epithets directed at
West by Obama's Chief of Staff, Rahm
Emanuel during a White House press
conference, calling West, in part, "fucking
whack," and, in the most printable portion of
his outburst, stating that "[West's] flow is like
Cheney's, after a double-shot of Metamucil."
Since that time, as West said in an interview,
"it's on."</p>

<p>The next big shot came a week later,
when rapper Twista, a member of the now polarized
Chicago hip-hop community, made
veiled references to Obama in a radio
interview on WGCI-FM, saying, "Some
people, you know, they come up here, and
then, as soon as they leave, they start hating
on their homeboys. They think it's okay, just
because they're off in Washington or
wherever."</p>

<p>Despite his early attempts to rise
above this feud, Obama was caught making
more off-the-record comments, calling West
"petty" and "immature" for perpetuating
something that "could be solved with a simple
apology." Obama's early reticence to
participate in the feud has not stopped
members of his crew from retaliating against
West, and there have been reports of Chicago
rapper, MC Common, joining forces with
Hilary Clinton, Joe Biden, and, in a surprising
show of bipartisanship, Condaleezza Rice, to
produce their own mix-tape. While the album
isn't scheduled to release for another week,
the lead track, "I'm'a Let U Finish (Making a
Fool of Yourself in the Public Eye)," has
already been leaked to the internet. Rumors
are flying that Obama can be heard rhyming a
verse on the track "Phil-a-Busta," despite his
seeming unwillingness to be involved further
in this feud.</p>

<p>In an exclusive interview, MC
Common said of Vice-President Biden, "He's
got amazing flow when you take away the
teleprompter&mdash;I know a lot of guys in the
[hip-hop] scene who only wish they could
freestyle like that."</p>

<p>Even Obama's Nobel Peace Prize has
not been able to bring an end to the feud; if
anything, it has only drawn out the conflict,
drawing more supporters to each side.
Following the announcement from
Stockholm, prominent right-wing pundit Rush
Limbaugh praised West on his talk show for
standing against Obama. Former Vice
President Dick Cheney has also issued a
statement that he would be interested in
collaborating with West on a future "hippie-hop
song." West issued a statement the
following day, saying, "fuck no."</p>

<p>Where the next shot will come from,
we can only speculate, but we hope that this
beef will come to a peaceful resolution before
the UN has to step in and hold talks.</p>
