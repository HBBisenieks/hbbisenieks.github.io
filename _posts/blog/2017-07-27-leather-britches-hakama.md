I never thought I'd practice a martial art.

I knew folks who did, sure. Two of my best friends praticed some form of karate when I was young. 
Even as I grew, I had people in my life who studied some martial art or other, even among my 
Quaker friends (Friends?). But it seemed antithetical to my Quaker practice.

I think I'd known about aikido for a long time. A good friend of my mother's--a good friend of 
mine, too--practiced, a fact I was reminded of recently. And Kurt, our Unitarian cook for every 
Quaker youth gathering of my teenage years.

I came to aikido for my health. To get my brain in a better space. And it's worked.

On the mat, I'm not worried about anything else. I _try_ not to worry about my aikido, either. 
I just try to be.

I came to aikido for balance and compassion, the two things I knew were central to the art from 
my peripheral experiences of it.

It wasn't until I'd been practicing at my dojo for several months that I really became aware of 
any of the teachings of Morihei Ueshiba, &#332;sensei, the founder of aikido, outside of the 
techniques I was fumbling my way through on the mat. My sensei includes a selection of quotes 
from &#332;sensei on the attendance sheet, one of which caught at something deep inside me.

"To injure an opponent is to injure yourself. To control aggression without inflicting injury 
is aikido."

My whole life, I've had varying comfort levels with the idea of God, but I've never questioned 
what I consider the central teaching of Quakerism, that there is that of God in everybody. 
From there, the testimony of peace seems a natural conclusion--to do violence to another 
person is to do violence to yourself.

I don't know what George Fox would have to say to &#332;sensei, if such a thing were possible, 
nor do I know what Fox would think of Friends practicing martial arts. At the risk of being 
flippant, though, I don't care. My faith and my practice are deeply linked. Insofar as I had 
philosophical thoughts at a younger age, I didn't think I'd practice a martial art because 
I didn't understand that there could be one that was compatible with my faith. When I'm on the 
mat, I'm training to take care of myself _and_ my opponent (and not just because that opponent 
is my training partner and friend).

Studying aikido isn't just moving towards mastery of the techniques. Aikido is as much a 
philosophy as a martial practice. When I'm on the mat, I can find that stillness of mind 
that I've so often struggled to find in my meetinghouse. When I'm on the mat, I can practice 
radical kindness for myself and my training partners. And isn't that what we need, in the end?
