Welcome back to In Brief, I guess.

Just in the last week or so, I've finished (or started and then
finished) three books I'd like to tell you about, all of which
I liked quite a lot.

First is *[Raven Stratagem](http://amzn.to/2xCEaff),* the second
book in Yoon Ha Lee's excellent *Machineries of Empire* series,
(of which [*Ninefox Gambit*](http://amzn.to/2wcTzm1) was the
first).

If you didn't read *Ninefox Gambit,* and if you like space opera,
you really owe it to yourself to read both of them. Without
getting into spoiler territory, *Raven Stratagem* picks up where
*Ninefox Gambit* left off and improves on pretty much every aspect
of the first book. The pacing is tight, the plot is full of
delightful twists, and the characters are wonderfully fleshed out.

*Ninefox Gambit* is my favorite book that was published in 2016,
and *Raven Stratagem* is in the running for my favorite new book
for 2017.

Next is *[The Girl with the Red Balloon](http://amzn.to/2yaxsKA),*
Katherine Locke's YA debut.

To call this book a time-travel book or a secret history would be
reductive. Yes, Ellie, one of the POV characters, travels back in
time from the present day to 1988, where she meets a group of
people who are using magic balloons to help imperiled folks
escape from East Berlin, but that doesn't capture the heart (or the
art) of this book.

*The Girl with the Red Balloon* is full of wonderful details and
characters. Katherine certainly did her research writing this, and
it comes through in the little, specific details. (And she put in
East Berlin's friggin *ghost stations* on the U-Bahn!) From the
craft side, too, this book is worthwhile, as it's told by three
interwoven first-person characters, each of whom has a distinct
voice. Even without the cues at the start of each chapter, I'm
pretty certain I could identify each POV character by how they
relate to the world.

It should be noted that this book is the first of a duology, but
it is a complete story, and the second book is more of a companion
than a sequel.

Lastly, speaking of duologies, is *[Taste of Marrow](http://amzn.to/2x5MRgu),*
by Sarah Gailey. *Taste of Marrow* is the sequel to Sarah's bloody,
rolicking novella debut, *River of Teeth,* which came out earlier
this year.

Where *River of Teeth* was a story of crime and revenge, *Taste of
Marrow* is ultimately a story of hope and redemption. Both volumes
of this duology are novellas, so depending on your reading speed,
you might be able to polish both off in a couple of hours, and you
really should read *River of Teeth* before *Taste of Marrow.* I
re-read *River of Teeth* just before *Taste of Marrow* arrived on
my doorstep, and I daresay that's the best way to consume them.

If you're in the mood for hippos, a diverse cast, and quite a lot
of blood and mayhem, I can't recommend these two books highly
enough.
