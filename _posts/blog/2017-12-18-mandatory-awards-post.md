Hello! Everyone is doing their Awards Eligibility Post&trade;
right now, so I guess I'll join in, yeah?

Short Stories:

"The Air Gap," published in the June issue of [LampLight Magazine](http://lamplightmagazine.com)

And that's it. I like my one credit this year a lot, and I'd be
staggered if any of y'all put it on your ballot. If you read it
and liked it, regardless of any awards consideration, thank you.
