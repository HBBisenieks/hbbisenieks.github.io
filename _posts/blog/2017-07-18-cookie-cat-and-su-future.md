We've been listening to the _Steven Universe, Vol. 1_ soundtrack a lot in my house lately, and we've 
also begun re-watching the series from the beginning because seriously, _Steven Universe._ (If you 
haven't watched the show before, do yourself a favor: stop reading this post and go watch a few 
episodes. They're short. I can wait.)

I came to the _SU_ fandom kinda late. A bunch of my friends and folks I looked up to online were 
raving about the show on Twitter, and I'd been looking for something new to watch. The episodes 
are really short, each running about 10 minutes including opening and closing credits, and really 
cute. And there's music. Nobody really told me there were songs in the show. It's not exactly a 
musical--not every episode has songs--but the songs usually drive the plot forward and show something 
about the characters singing them. It's pretty great.

When I say the show is cute, I really do mean it. It's sweet and has a lot to say, and the messages 
in the show are really nice. I'm glad that I'm alive at the same time that _Steven Universe_ is a thing. 
But the show gets dark sometimes. I mean, the episode "Cat Fingers" is some brilliant body horror. In 
a show that's ostensibly for kids. But beyond the bits that are played for a scare, there's something 
else.

We're around episode 30 of the first season, and the show has started hinting at that darkness, 
especially with the arrival and departure of Lapis Lazuli and Pearl's longing for the stars in "Space 
Race."

Which brings me back to Cookie Cat. This is from the very first episode, and, well, just take a listen.

For first-time viewers, Cookie Cat's tragic backstory may just play for laughs. Hell, I think it's a 
little funny in an absurd kind of way that a cat-shaped ice cream sandwich would be given such a deep 
backstory. And I'm a little in awe that they can tell that story so succinctly. It fits in a 30-second 
song. But as someone who's all caught up at the time of this writing, that song also feels a lot like 
foreshadowing of what's to come for Steven and the Crystal Gems. Intersetllar war? Lost family? Check 
and check.

Heck.
