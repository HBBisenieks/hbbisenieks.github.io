It's the middle of December, and I don't know if I'm going to get
anything new out the door or get anything that's out back in time
to send it out again, so I guess this is as good a time as any for
a year-in-review post.

2017 in submissions:
* 47 story submissions sent (down from 54 in 2016)
* 1 sale (!!!)
* 37 form rejections (down from 39 in 2016)
* 9 personal rejections (down from 14 in 2016)
* 1 story published
* 1 new story in circulation (and one more that'd been sitting out pending a heavy revision)

I was hoping to meet my average of one submission a week again this
year, but missing that mark by 5 isn't bad by any stretch, and this
is still my second best year for raw submission numbers (and
absolute best year for paid sales) since I started this hustle back
in 2006, and that ain't bad.

Considering how rough 2017 was in general, I'm counting everything
as a victory, and there are still a few weeks left in the year.

As far as writing goes, I didn't end up producing that much new
stuff this year that actually went out into the world. One new
story, and one more that hadn't been on sub since its first
outing in 2016, where it came back with a very nice, helpful
personal rejection that I didn't know at the time how to act on.
In addition to those stories, there were a couple more pieces that
are finishing out the year at various states of drafting, so
hopefully I'll get some of those out the door early in 2018. Maybe.

As far as surprises for the year go, I'm a little shocked that
November didn't come in as my lowest-submission month, given that
I was traveling for half the month. In fact, November came in
second, with 6 submissions, while August led the way with 8 subs.
However, the biggest surprise for me was my sale, which came in
in March. Obviously, we always hope that the things we write and
send out will sell, but the wording of my acceptance letter
started out so similarly to all the rejections I've gotten (225
lifetime rejections as of this writing), that I had to go back and
re-read the thing a couple times for it to get through.

My goal, again, for 2018 is to hit 52 submissions for the year,
which means I'll have to put some more things in circulation, so
my other 2018 goal is to get up to 10 stories into the rotation.
Wish me luck.
