It's NaNoWriMo! I'm not participating, because I know full well
that I'm doing too many things this month, and trying to write
fifty thousand words on top of all that is unrealistic.

But that doesn't mean that you can't. Because you can! You can do
the thing! And if you, like me, would like to over-complicate an
already difficult endeavor, maybe you want to have a way to update
your wordcount from the command line. (I mean, if you're trying to
keep yourself from getting distracted while you're trying to do
your daily 1800-ish words, then opening a browser to update your
word count is likely to lead you off-track. It does for me, anyway.)

So, for you, you wonderful dork, a Gist. May it serve you well.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/HBBisenieks/702f8f5d19b780503b0a.js"></script>

In case you're wondering how *I* use this script, I usually do my
NaNoWriMo projects in plain text, writing in chunks every day,
usually named something like "chunk_20171101.txt," with all those
chunks in a project folder. Since my main writing machine uses
Xmonad as its window manager, I can just program a custom keyboard
shortcut to invoke this script whenever I want.

So, with my blessing, take this terrible bit of bodged-together
code, and if you find it useful, I don't know, tweet at me or
something.
