Another In Brief because I'm feeling a bit brief.

You maybe didn't know I like hip-hop. Well, I do. And among artists, the Doomtree 
collective is one of my favorites, both as a unit as as component parts. So I was 
quite thrilled to hear that several of their members were undertaking a new side-project, 
Shredders.

I could spend a lot of words telling you about how much I like their beats or waxing 
poetic about the interplay between P.O.S. and Sims' verses, but, like, their EP is 
only three tracks. Just take a listen (if that's what you're into).

I will say that I'm glad their LP, *Dangerous Jumps,* is coming out in November, 
because the first couple dozen times I listened to their EP, I finished it just a 
little mad that there wasn't more of it.

Anyway. Shredders. Dig it.
