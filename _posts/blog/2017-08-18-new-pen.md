I like fountain pens.

I didn't mean to get into them, particularly. I mean, I did? But not?

I'm not like some crazy collector. I have five. Five pens is a reasonable
number of pens. And I'd be sad if I lost any of them, but not, devastated.
Certainly I wouldn't be looking at trying to replace some hundred-plus-dollar
object if one of them took a walk.

But I still tend to keep them all in one place. Which is kinda a shame,
because I really like writing with them, and if they're all at home, that's
really limiting.

I could get some disposable fountain pens, of course. They're fine. But I
don't really like the part where they're meant to be used up and then thrown
away. There is no away.

So imagine how pleased I was to find a fountain pen at my local Daiso (a chain
of stores in my area that carry lots of Japanese goods). A refillable fountain
pen for $1.50? Sign me up.

I've been using this thing pretty regularly for about a week, and it's really
quite nice. It came with a cartridge of blue-black ink that's more on the blue
end, a touch darker than the ink in a blue Pilot Varsity disposable fountain
pen. It's got a medium nib that's a little finer than the Varsity medium, which
is alright by me.

I haven't written through the cartridge it came with yet, and I got a five-pack
of extra cartridges at the same time that I bought it, but I'm pretty certain
that it would accept a Pelikan converter, though I'd feel a little silly fitting
such a cheap pen with a converter that cost more than it several times over.

The best part, though, is that, while I'd prefer not to lose this pen, I'm
much less worried about its going missing or being borrowed off my desk and
then never returned, because, frankly, a dollar fifty isn't that much money.
